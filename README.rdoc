css_doc is a Ruby library and command line tool to extract documentation from CSS files. The format of the documentation is very similar to JavaDoc.

css_doc was inspired by the CSSDOC[http://cssdoc.net/] project, but it is NOT a complete implementation of the proposed standard, although it should be fairly compatible. As there is no documentation extractor for the CSSDOC standard, this project should fill the gap for many people.

== Features

* Extracts file-scope documentation for each CSS source file.
* Extracts documentation for rule sets (i.e. a set of selectors separated by commas with a declaration).
* Files can be separated into several sections.
* For rule set documentation, html code examples can be incorporated into the documentation.
* Generates selector, section and file index pages.

== What does it look like?

Here you can find an example of a generated documentation: http://opensource.imedo.de/css_doc/index.html. This is the documentation for the stylesheet[http://opensource.imedo.de/stylesheets/style.css] that we use for our opensource site.

As another Example, consider the famous reset style sheet, documented with css_doc:

  /**
  * @file reset.css
  * @author Eric Meyer, documented by Thomas Kadauke
  * @css-for IE 5, IE 6, IE 7, IE 8, Safari 3, Safari 4, Firefox 2, Firefox 3
  */

  /**
  * @section Reset styles
  * These styles reset the default style sheet that comes with the user agent.
  */

  /**
  * Set margins and paddings to 0, and font-properties to a default value.
  */

  }
  /**

  * Remember to define focus styles in after this declaration.
  */
  :focus {
    outline: 0;
  }
  /**

    line-height: 1;
    color: black;
    background: white;
  }
  /**

    list-style: none;
  }
  /*
  * Remove default table styling.
  * Tables still need 'cellspacing="0"' in the markup.
  */
  table {
    border-collapse: separate;
    border-spacing: 0;
  }
  /**
  * Reset text alignment and typography for special tags.
  */
  caption, th, td {
    text-align: left;
    font-weight: normal;
  }

== Dependencies

* CSSPool > 2.0.0 (http://github.com/tenderlove/csspool)
* Patched version of libcroco-0.6.2, see below

== Installation

The easiest way to install this gem is directly via the github gem 
repository:

 $ sudo gem install imedo-css_doc -s http://gems.github.com

For css_doc to work, you need the latest version of CSSPool (2.0.0). CSSPool depends on libcroco, which can be installed on OS X via

 $ brew install libcroco

To download the latest version of libcroco which is v0.6.8, and can be located at http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/libcroco/0.6/, edit the latest Homebrew formula to include the following:

    url 'http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/libcroco/0.6/libcroco-0.6.8.tar.xz'
    sha256 'ea6e1b858c55219cefd7109756bff5bc1a774ba7a55f7d3ccd734d6b871b8570'

Then you can run the brew install command. That will install libcroco v0.6.8 which has apparently fixed the previous bug which prevented css-doc from utilizing csspool. (Issue can be found here: https://github.com/tkadauke/css_doc/issues/1)

== Usage

=== As command line client

To get help, type

 $ cssdoc --help

The command line options are

  -o, --output=dir                 Specify output directory
  -s, --skip=files                 Skip specified files
  -p, --project-name=name          Specify Project name
  -v, --[no-]verbose               Run verbosely
  -t, --template=name/path         Specify template or template path

You can specifiy the input directory as an optional last parameter. The default is the current directory. For skipped files, a comma-separated list of file names relative to the input directory is expected.

The default options usually work well. Just go to your repository root, and type

 $ cssdoc

=== In Rakefiles

To define a rake task for css_doc, add the following to your Rakefile:

  require 'rake/css_doc_task'

  # only if libcroco is not found automatically
  ENV['LIBCROCO'] = '/path/to/libcroco'

  Rake::CSSDocTask.new('doc:css') do |task|
    task.input_dir = 'public/stylesheets' # default
    task.output_dir = 'css_doc' # default

    task.project_name = 'my_project'
    task.skip_files = ['base_packaged.css', 'print_packaged.css']
    task.verbose = true
  end

== TODO

* Implement more tags
* Make default template pretty
* Include more templates
